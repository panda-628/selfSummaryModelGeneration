---------------------1/10---------:
Summary_rules:To generate useful modeling rules for students based on the provided answers, let's follow the steps outlined.

### Step 2: Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts

1. **Missing "Generalization" in Use Cases**: The student answers do not properly reflect the generalization aspect of querying tickets (`(Query by Station)` and `(Query by Train Number)` should generalize `(Query Tickets)`).

2. **Association Misuse**: Using "associate" instead of "include" or "extend" where needed. For instance, it should be "include" between `Purchase Ticket` and `Log In`, and `Cancel Ticket` and `Log In` instead of "associate".

3. **Inconsistent Terminology**: The student answers use different terminologies, such as "Check Remaining Tickets" instead of "Query Tickets", which would align with the system description more closely.

4. **Redundant Relationships**: The use of "associate" between the customer and operations like “Check Remaining Tickets” and “Check Train Time” doesn't align with either the provided system description or the referenced answer.

5. **Misplaced Use Case Logic**: The relationship `Log In` extending `Retrieve Password` is incorrect; it should be `Retrieve Password` extending `Log In` since retrieving a password is an alternative to logging in.

### Step 3: Locate Related Sentences in System Description

1. The system allows queries by train number and station, as indicated by "two ways to query the train time: station query and train number query."

2. The authentication process relies on logging in first, as stated: "Whether it is to buy a ticket or cancel a ticket, the user must log in to the system first."

3. The purpose of retrieving a password and the login system should be clear from the description, which references "if you forget your password when logging in to the system, you can also retrieve your password."

### Step 4: Inductively Summarize Common Rules

Given the identified incorrect and incomplete parts, the following rules can be established to guide students in object-oriented class diagram modeling:

### Final Rules
```rule
+ Rule 1: Clearly define use cases and ensure they correspond to the operations described in the system. Each use case should be inclusive of the necessary authentication procedures where applicable.
+ Rule 2: Utilize proper relationships: "include" for mandatory associations and "extend" for optional ones. Avoid using "associate" for direct relationships between actors and use cases.
+ Rule 3: Maintain consistency in terminology across the diagram and the system description to avoid confusion, ensuring the use cases are named correctly.
+ Rule 4: Utilize generalization relationships where applicable to show the hierarchy among use cases, especially for querying operations.
```

These rules structure the advice for students to effectively use object-oriented modeling practices in a clear and systematic manner.

This structure presents a clear overview of the interactions between the Customer and the various use cases of the train ticket booking system, ensuring the relationships are correctly established according to object-oriented modeling rules.
---------------------2/10---------:
Summary_rules:To assist students in improving their understanding of modeling methodology in object-oriented class diagram modeling, we will analyze the incorrect and incomplete parts of the provided student answers in relation to the system description. We will then distill general modeling rules from these observations.

### Step 2: Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts

The following issues are identified in the student answers:

1. **Use Case Names:**
   - Incorrect/Inconsistent terms used for "Check Remaining Tickets" and "Check Train Time" which are described in the system description as "query tickets" and "check tickets schedule." 

2. **Relationships:**
   - Use of "associate" instead of appropriate relationships like "include," "extend," or "generalize" for modeling the use cases. 
   - Mentioning "Login" as a separate use case instead of incorporating it properly into the relevant use cases, which was specified to be a prerequisite for purchasing and canceling tickets.

3. **Actor Definition:**
   - The presence of "System" as an actor in one answer is incorrect according to the system description, which only references "Customer" as an actor.

### Step 3: Locate Exact Sentences from System Description

1. **Use Cases:**
   - System Description: "customers can purchase tickets, cancel tickets, check the remaining tickets and check the train time."
   - Incorrect interpretations of this in the answers where terms like "Check Remaining Tickets" weren't matched to any specific model and used inconsistently.

2. **Login:**
   - System Description: "Whether it is to buy a ticket or cancel a ticket, the user must log in to the system first."
   - This indicates that "Login" should be represented as a prerequisite, influencing "Purchase Tickets" and "Cancel Tickets" instead of being independent.

3. **Actors:**
   - Only "Customer" is an actor according to the system description, thus any mention of "System" is incorrect.

### Step 4: Inductively Summarize Common Rules

Based on the identified issues from the student answers, the following general rules for object-oriented modeling can be developed:

```rule
+ Rule 1: Ensure use cases and actors are clearly defined as per the descriptions provided, using consistent terminology found in the system specification.
+ Rule 2: Utilize the appropriate relationships between use cases, such as "include," "extend," and "generalize," instead of overly generic associations.
+ Rule 3: Clearly represent any prerequisites for use cases (such as logging in) within the relevant use cases rather than as standalone or independent entities.
+ Rule 4: Limit the actors to those explicitly mentioned in the system description, avoiding the introduction of additional entities unless specified.
``` 

These rules are designed to provide students with a clear framework for constructing accurate and consistent object-oriented models. Following these guidelines will enhance their understanding and application of modeling methodologies.

---------------------3/10---------:
Summary_rules:Let's analyze the student answers in comparison to the provided system description and the referenced answer.

### Step 2: Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts in Student Answers

1. **Incorrect Actor Inclusion**: The students included "System" as an actor, which is incorrect since the system itself is not an actor in the use case diagram.
2. **Incomplete Use Case Descriptions**: The students did not include "Query Tickets," which is a distinct functionality described in the system overview.
3. **Incorrect Use Case Associations**:
   - The relationship for "Retrieve Password" is stated as extending "Log In," which is incorrect according to the referenced answer where it extends from a different context.
   - The "Check Remaining Tickets" use case was not associated with any specific action for logging in, though it should relate to "Log In" indirectly via "Purchase Ticket" or "Cancel Ticket."

### Step 3: Locate Correct Sentences in System Description

1. **Actors**: The system description specifies that the only actor is "Customer."
   - Incorrect Sentence: The student answers include "System" as an actor.
   
2. **Use Cases**: The description outlines that customers can perform specific operations which include querying for tickets but does not explicitly separate these into more fine-grained use cases.
   - Missing Usage: "Query Tickets" is mentioned in the referenced answer but absent in student submissions.

3. **Relationship Requirement**:
   - "Whether it is to buy a ticket or cancel a ticket, the user must log in." indicates that these operations must include the login action without being direct associations to the login.
   - The referenced answer specifically associates the "Retrieve Password" use case to extend from "Log In", not the other way.

### Step 4: Inductively Summarize Common Rules for OO Modeling

Based on the identified issues, we can summarize the following general rules for object-oriented modeling:

### Final Rules

```rule
+ Rule 1: Only include relevant actors that directly interact with the system; do not add the system itself as an actor.
+ Rule 2: Ensure that all identified functionalities in the system description are reflected in the use case diagram without omission.
+ Rule 3: Use appropriate relationships that accurately reflect the interactions as described; clarify which use cases must be completed before others can be executed.
+ Rule 4: Ensure that extend and include relationships accurately represent the dependencies and influences between use cases, following the correct logical flow of operations.
``` 

These rules provide concise guidance that students can apply to ensure their object-oriented class diagram modeling is both accurate and relevant to the system being described.

This structured use case diagram captures the defined interactions and ensures that all functionalities are included and associated correctly according to the given description.
---------------------4/10---------:
Summary_rules:Let's break down the analysis and derive the modeling rules step by step.

### Step 2: Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts in Student Answers

1. **Actors Definition**: In the student answers, "Log In" is listed as a use case, but it is not an actor. It's a process that the user needs to undergo to access other functionalities. 

2. **Use Cases Invalid Associations**: 
   - The student answers incorrectly use "associate" for the relationships between the customer and the use cases. The appropriate relationship expressions should include "include" for required actions or "extend" for optional actions. 
   - The phrase "Check Remaining Tickets" incorrectly suggests independent querying and fails to distinguish associating between querying tickets in general versus independently checking.

3. **Use Case Representation**:
   - The use cases are not properly defined in terms of what they entitle. For example, “Check Train Time” should have better alignment with the specific queries like “Query by Station” and “Query by Train Number”.

4. **Incorrect Extension Use**: The student's last answer indicates that the relationship (Log In) extend (Retrieve Password) is incorrect. "Retrieve Password" is essential functionality to the log-in process and should arguably be an include relationship, not an extend.

### Step 3: Locate Exact Sentences from System Description

1. **For Actors**:
   - **System Description**: “In the train ticket booking system, customers can…”
   - **Explanation**: The actor should be the entity enabling the functionality, which is the Customer, and "Log In" does not qualify as a separate actor.

2. **For Incorrect Relationships**:
   - **System Description**: “Whether it is to buy a ticket or cancel a ticket, the user must log in to the system first.”
   - **Explanation**: The use of 'associate' does not properly define the dependency of the operations on the log-in use case which should be highlighted as an 'include'.

3. **For Use Case Representation**:
   - **System Description**: “... check the remaining tickets and check the train time.”
   - **Explanation**: This implies that there should be a direct relationship of checking overall tickets coupled with time queries based on more specific operations.

4. **For Incorrect Extension Use**:
   - **System Description**: “If you forget your password when logging in to the system, you can also retrieve your password.”
   - **Explanation**: Retrieving the password is part of the log-in functionalities hence it is a required activity which necessitates an include relationship.

### Step 4: Inductively Summarize Common Rules for OO Modeling

1. **Defining Actors**: Ensure that all entities interacting with the system are classified as actors, while mechanisms or system processes should be excluded from this classification.

2. **Relationship Specification**: Clearly differentiate between relationships:
   - Use "include" for cases where one use case must occur as part of another.
   - Use "extend" for optional extensions of use cases.
   - "Association" should be avoided unless denoting direct relationships without dependencies.

3. **Level of Detail**: Use cases should encapsulate whole processes and features accurately, linking broader use cases with their specific operational scenarios clearly.

4. **Correct Usage of Extend vs. Include**: When defining relationships, ensure you comprehend the necessity of the function – if one is contingent upon the other, use include; if it adds optional functionality, use extend.

### Final Modeling Rules

```rule
+ Rule 1: Clearly define actors as entities interacting with the system, excluding processes or operations from being classified as actors.
+ Rule 2: Use "include" to denote necessary dependencies between use cases and "extend" for optional additions, avoiding vague associations unless indicating simple relationships.
+ Rule 3: Maintain clarity in representing use case relationships to encompass complete functional scenarios while distinguishing general and specific operations.
+ Rule 4: Accurately assess the nature of relationships when modeling to determine whether to employ "include" or "extend" based on whether the functionality is mandatory or optional.

Summary_rules:To assist students in improving their object-oriented modeling methodology based on the review of their responses, I will identify the incorrect or incomplete parts of the student answers compared to the system description and the referenced answer. Here are the findings:

### Incorrect/Incompleted Parts Identified

1. **Actors Incomplete**: 
   - Some students included a "System Admin" as an actor, which is not mentioned in the system description. 
   - Example sentences in the system description: "customers can purchase tickets...". The description explicitly states that customers are involved without mentioning any administrator role. 

2. **Use Cases Inconsistent**:
   - The phrase "Check Remaining Tickets" is used, whereas the correct terminology should be "Query Tickets" as per the system description and referenced answer.
   - Example sentences in the referenced answer: "Query Tickets" is explicitly included as a distinct use case.

3. **Incorrect Relationships**:
   - The relationships such as "(Purchase Ticket) extend (Log In)" and "(Cancel Ticket) extend (Log In)" are incorrectly defined; it should be "include" as confirmed by the referenced answer.
   - Example sentences in the referenced answer: The use cases specifically state “(Purchase Tickets) include (Log in)” not extend.

4. **Query Structure**:
   - Some students incorrectly structured how train time queries are related to other operations. The referenced answer makes clear that "Query by Train Number" and "Query by Station" are generalizations of "Query Tickets" which has not been followed in the student responses.
   - Example sentences in the referenced answer: “(Query by Station) generalize (Query Tickets)” and so forth.

### Summarized Rules for Object-Oriented Modeling

```rule
+ Rule 1: Identify and include only the actors explicitly defined in the system description; do not introduce unrelated roles.
+ Rule 2: Use terminology consistently as defined; ensure use cases match the provided descriptions.
+ Rule 3: Distinguish between "include" and "extend" relationships correctly based on the context provided; include relationships for mandatory interactions and extend for optional.
+ Rule 4: Structure relationships accurately by following generalization and specialization correctly; ensure sub-categories are represented as generalizations of their parent use cases.
+ Rule 5: Maintain clear and correct associations between actors and use cases according to the specific interactions mentioned in the description; avoid loose or ambiguous associations.
``` 

These rules are crafted to help students broadly apply the principles of object-oriented modeling effectively in various scenarios.

Summary_rules:To assist students in developing their object-oriented modeling skills and methodology, I will review the errors in the student answers based on the provided system description and the referenced answer. After identifying the mistakes, I will create general modeling rules that can be easily applied to future assignments.

### Incorrect and Incomplete Parts

1. **Incorrect Names for Use Cases:**
   - The student answers use "Check Remaining Tickets" and "Check Train Time." However, the referenced answer specifies "Query Tickets" and "Check Tickets Schedule." The term "Check" in the context, when related to querying, may lead to semantic confusion about the nature of operations.

   **Related Sentences from System Description:**
   - "Customers can purchase tickets, cancel tickets, check the remaining tickets and check the train time..."

   **Explanation:**
   - The term "check" is not the same as "query" in the context of a system operation. "Query" implies a retrieval or search function, while "check" is less specific about the action performed. Accuracy in naming use cases is crucial for clarity and proper understanding of system functionalities.

2. **Incorrect Use of Include and Extend Relationships:**
   - The student answers use associations for “Log In” and associate it incorrectly with some use cases instead of the specified include relationships as found in the referenced answer.

   **Related Sentences from System Description:**
   - "Whether it is to buy a ticket or cancel a ticket, the user must log in to the system first."

   **Explanation:**
   - It must be made clear that "Log In" is a prerequisite action that should be included in the "Purchase Tickets" and "Cancel Tickets" use cases. It cannot simply be an association since it directly affects the ability to execute these use cases.

3. **Generalization Misuse:**
   - The student failed to implement correct generalization for the query use cases by simply stating "Station Query" and "Train Number Query" without relating them properly to the broader "Query Tickets" case as in the referenced answer.

   **Related Sentences from System Description:**
   - "There are two ways to query the train time: station query and train number query."

   **Explanation:**
   - These specific queries should generalize from a broader use case "Query Tickets," reflecting that they are types of queries.

### Common Modeling Rules Induced from Errors

Based on the identified issues, the following rules can be established for object-oriented modeling:

```rule
+ Rule 1: Use precise and consistent terminology in naming use cases to ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity.
+ Rule 2: Accurately represent relationships between use cases using include for mandatory prerequisite actions and extend for optional enhancements.
+ Rule 3: When modeling hierarchical relationships, ensure that specific use cases correctly generalize from broader use cases where applicable.
``` 

These rules are designed to enhance understanding and improve the accuracy of future modeling assignments in object-oriented design.

---------------------7/10---------:
Summary_rules:To help students improve their understanding and application of object-oriented class diagram modeling, I've identified issues found in the provided student answers in relation to the system description and the referenced answer. Following the analysis, I've formulated rules that encapsulate best practices for OO modeling.

### Identified Issues in Student Answers

1. **Inclusion of 'System' as an Actor**: In the student answers, 'System' was added as an actor, which is unnecessary as the system itself is not an actor that performs actions. 

   - *System Description Reference*: The system allows operations (e.g., purchasing tickets, checking train times) but does not act as a user or a system user.
   - *Explanation*: Actors represent entities that interact with the system, typically users or other systems that initiate or receive actions. Including 'System' is misleading.

2. **Missing Generalization for Query Use Cases**: The student answers did not use generalization appropriately between 'Query by Station' and 'Query by Train Number', which were treated as separate distinct use cases without a common parent use case.

   - *System Description Reference*: The description allows for querying train times either by station or train number, indicating that these are variations of a broader query mechanism.
   - *Explanation*: Generalization is critical when different functionalities share a commonality, reducing redundancy in modeling.

3. **Improper Use of Include and Extend Relationships**: The students incorrectly used include and extend relationships for certain operations, such as associating 'Log in' directly as an include for other use cases incorrectly and treating 'Retrieve Password' as extending 'Log in.' 

   - *System Description Reference*: Both 'Purchase Tickets' and 'Cancel Tickets' require users to be logged in first, establishing a direct requirement rather than an optional scenario.
   - *Explanation*: Use relationships correctly to show essential actions that need to occur before others, rather than using extend, which implies optional behavior.

### Summarized Modeling Rules

Based on the inspection of student answers and their relation to the system description, here are the practical rules:

```rule
+ Rule 1: Clearly define actors as entities that initiate or interact with the system; do not include the system itself as an actor.
+ Rule 2: Use generalization to group similar use cases that share common functionality, reducing redundancy.
+ Rule 3: Apply include relationships for essential use cases that must occur as part of another use case; use extend relationships only for optional scenarios or exceptional cases.
``` 

By following these rules, students can create clearer and more accurate object-oriented models.
---------------------7/10---------:
Improve_result:Based on the provided description and the rules outlined, here is the use case diagram for the train ticket booking system:

### Actors:

Purchase Tickets  
Cancel Tickets  
Check Remaining Tickets  
Check Train Time  
Query by Station  
Query by Train Number  

### Associations:

(Customer) can (Check Remaining Tickets)  
(Customer) can (Check Train Time)  
(Check Train Time) generalize (Query by Station)  
(Check Train Time) generalize (Query by Train Number)  

This representation captures the relationships and interactions of the actors and use cases within the train ticket booking system, following the outlined best practices for object-oriented modeling.
---------------------8/10---------:
Summary_rules:1. Review of Student Answers reveals several incorrect and incomplete elements when compared to the Reference Answer, particularly in how use case associations, inclusions, and extensions are handled.

2. Analyze the Student Answers for inaccuracies: 

   - **Inclusion of use cases**: The use cases were sometimes incorrectly marked as associations instead of inclusions. 
   - **Use of the extend relationship**: Some answers erroneously included use cases that should use an extend relationship as standard associations.
   - **Generalization of queries**: The queries by station and train number should be generalized, but several student responses treated them differently.

3. Identifying the relevant parts from the System Description and explaining the errors:

   - **Errors in Log In Associations**: In multiple answers, associations between "Log In" and ticket operations are presented as "include." However, based on the description, "Log In" is a prerequisite for these actions and should be included instead. 
     - *Related Description*: "Whether it is to buy a ticket or cancel a ticket, the user must log in to the system first."
     - *Explanation*: The student misunderstood the role of the "Log In" use case; it is not a function that is part of ticket purchasing or cancellation but a prerequisite.

   - **Retrieving Password**: The association with "Log In" is marked incorrectly.
     - *Related Description*: "If you forget your password when logging in to the system, you can also retrieve your password."
     - *Explanation*: "Retrieve Password" should extend "Log In" since it is a specialized behavior that occurs when there is an issue with logging in rather than a standard behavior that is always executed.

   - **Generalization of Query Use Cases**: Multiple student responses failed to generalize "Query by Station" and "Query by Train Number."
     - *Related Description*: The description allows for two different ways to query the train time.
     - *Explanation*: The model should reflect that both types of queries are variations of the more general use case of querying tickets.

4. Inductive summarization leads to the following rules:

```rule
+ Rule 1: Ensure that prerequisites for use cases are modeled as inclusions rather than associations.
+ Rule 2: Use extend relationships for specialized behaviors that modify or enhance standard use cases instead of treating them as primary use cases.
+ Rule 3: Utilize generalization to represent common behaviors that can be subclassed into specific functionalities.
```

---------------------9/10---------:
Summary_rules:1. **Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts**

   - Although the students identified most of the use cases correctly, some terms used in the answers are inconsistent with the system description.
     - **Incorrect Use Cases**: "Check Remaining Tickets" and "Check Train Time" should be represented differently.
     - **Incorrect Relationships**: The relationships and the types of associations (include, extend, etc.) are incorrectly applied in some instances.

2. **Locate Exact Sentences from System Description and Explain**

   - **Incorrect Use Case**: "Check Remaining Tickets" is not specifically mentioned; the phrase used in the description is "check remaining tickets," which implies a specific ticket status rather than a distinct use case. 
   - **Incorrect Relationship for Use Cases**:
     - "Check Train Time" in some answers used both "include" and "extend" incorrectly for the queries (Station Query and Train Number Query). The system description refers to the queries as ways to gather information under "Check the train time" but does not define each as individual roles/extensions.

3. **Summarize Common Rules for OO Modeling**

   - **General Principles**: 
     - Use cases must accurately reflect the operations as described in the system documentation. If the description does not distinctly mention an operation, it should not be inferred as a separate use case.
     - Relationships between use cases should align with their logical structure as prescribed in the system description. 
     - Clarify the nature of associations: "include" should be used for operations that can't happen without the other (like logging in), while "extend" should indicate optional scenarios.

4. **Final Rules**

```rule
+ Rule 1: Ensure that use cases directly reflect operations mentioned in the system description and do not infer additional use cases that are not stated.
+ Rule 2: Clearly distinguish between "include" and "extend" relationships and use them according to the logical dependencies outlined in the system description.
```
---------------------9/10---------:
Improve_result:Based on the provided description and following the rules mentioned, here's the structured use case diagram representation:

**Actors:**
- Customer

**Use Cases:**
- Login
- Purchase Ticket
- Cancel Ticket
- Check Remaining Tickets
- Check Train Time
- Retrieve Password
- Query Train Time by Station
- Query Train Time by Train Number

**Associations:**
- (Customer) can (Login)
- (Customer) can (Purchase Ticket)
- (Customer) can (Cancel Ticket)
- (Customer) can (Check Remaining Tickets)
- (Customer) can (Check Train Time)
- (Customer) can (Retrieve Password)
- (Check Train Time) include (Query Train Time by Station)
- (Check Train Time) include (Query Train Time by Train Number)
- (Login) extend (Retrieve Password)
- (Purchase Ticket) include (Login)
- (Cancel Ticket) include (Login)

### Explanation of Associations:
- **Login**: This use case is necessary for both purchasing and canceling tickets, indicating it must be included each time.
- **Retrieve Password**: This extends the Login use case; it's an optional scenario for users who have forgotten their password.
- **Check Train Time**: This use case includes two specific ways of querying the train time, which are not distinct operations but rather methods of gathering information under the broader function of checking train time.

This structure thus accurately reflects the operations directly mentioned in the system description while adhering to the established rules for correct use case identification and relationship types.

Summary_rules:To provide students with effective modeling rules in object-oriented class diagram modeling, we will analyze the provided student answers against the system description and referenced answer. 

### Step 2: Identification of Incorrect Parts in Student Answers
- **Incorrect or Incomplete Use Cases:**
  - "Check Remaining Tickets" is not specified in the system description; the correct term should be aligned with the system functions.
  - "Check Train Time" should not be treated as a single entity but rather requires distinction in querying methods.
  
- **Incorrect Relationships:**
  - Multiple associations as “associate” are used, while the terms “include” and “extend” are more appropriate for use cases.
  - The usage of "include" and "extend" appears to be not fully aligned; "Retrieve Password" extends "Log In", but the inclusion of log in in purchase and cancellation use cases should not be labeled as "include," as it is a prerequisite action.

### Step 3: Explanation of Incorrect Parts
1. **Check Remaining Tickets:**
   - This term does not appear in the system description. The functionalities indicate that users should be able to purchase or cancel tickets but do not mention checking the remaining tickets. The inferred use case should be aligned with system operations.
  
2. **Check Train Time:**
   - This term needs to be clarified into two separate operations—Station Query and Train Number Query—as specified in the system description. It is incorrect to lump these functionalities together.

3. **Relationships:**
   - The term “associate” is too vague and doesn’t specify the nature of interactions clearly. “Include” and “extend” should be employed to clarify how use cases relate to one another—a distinction that is crucial in use case modeling.

### Step 4: Summary of Common Modeling Rules
Based on the errors identified in the student answers, the following common rules can be established for effective object-oriented modeling:

```rule
+ Rule 1: Clearly define use cases based on system functionalities and avoid adding terms that do not appear in the system description.
+ Rule 2: Use precise relationships such as "include" and "extend" to indicate how use cases interact rather than using vague terms like "associate."
+ Rule 3: Break down composite functionalities into distinct use cases to represent all user interactions accurately.
+ Rule 4: Ensure prerequisites for actions (like logging in) are not treated as separate use cases to prevent modeling redundancies.
+ Rule 5: Always align your modeling terms and relationships with the vocabulary and descriptions provided in the system requirements.
``` 

These rules are designed to ensure a thorough understanding of object-oriented modeling principles and reinforce several key practices.

Improve_result:Based on your description and the provided rules for creating an effective use case diagram, here is the structured format for actors, use cases, and associations:

Actors:
- Customer
- System

Use Cases:
- Log In
- Retrieve Password
- Purchase Ticket
- Cancel Ticket
- Station Query
- Train Number Query

Associations:
- (Customer) can (Log In)
- (Log In) include (Retrieve Password)
- (Customer) can (Purchase Ticket)
- (Purchase Ticket) include (Log In)
- (Customer) can (Cancel Ticket)
- (Cancel Ticket) include (Log In)
- (Customer) can (Station Query)
- (Customer) can (Train Number Query) 

This format adheres to the modeling rules established and correctly incorporates the functionalities described in your system requirements while ensuring clarity in use case associations.
