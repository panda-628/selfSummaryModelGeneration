Summary_rules:### Step 2: Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts

1. Many student answers incorrectly include "System" as an actor. According to the system description, only "Customer" is mentioned as an actor.
2. The use of "Check Remaining Tickets" instead of "Query Tickets" does not align with the referenced answer, which specifies "Query Tickets" as the relevant use case.
3. The associations created using "associate" terminology instead of "can" or the proper inclusion and extension relationships are not accurately reflecting the relationships as specified in the referenced answer. For instance, the "extend" relationship is applied incorrectly in the students' answers (e.g., "Log in extended by Retrieve Password" instead of the correct indication that "Retrieve Password" extends "Log in").
4. Inconsistency in naming conventions (capitalization differences) such as "Log In" vs. "Log in" and "Purchase Ticket" vs. "Purchase tickets".

### Step 3: Locate Exact Sentences in System Description

1. System description states: "customers can purchase tickets, cancel tickets...". This implies "Customer" is the only actor, not "System."
2. The description uses "check the remaining tickets," which corresponds to the referenced answer term "Query Tickets."
3. The relationships stated in the referenced answer make clear distinctions via terms like "include" and "extend," which are not replicated accurately in the students' modeling.
4. Consistency in naming is critical, as seen in the referenced model: each use case should follow a consistent naming pattern.

### Step 4: Inductively Summarize Common Rules

1. Only include relevant actors based on the system description; avoid adding extraneous actors not mentioned in the description.
2. Use terminology for use cases consistently with the referenced answer and maintain uniformity in naming conventions.
3. Apply the correct association verbs (e.g., "can," "include," "extend") as specified in the referenced answer, rather than using generic terms like "associate."
4. Ensure that the relationships among use cases clearly reflect the hierarchical nature of use cases by distinguishing between "include" and "extend" correctly.

### Step 5: Generate Clear and Concise Rules

```rule
+ Rule 1: Only include relevant actors based on the system description; do not add extraneous actors that are not specified.
+ Rule 2: Use consistent terminology for use cases and ensure uniformity in naming conventions, including capitalization.
+ Rule 3: Apply specific association verbs (e.g., "can," "include," "extend") as described in the reference answer and avoid generic terms like "associate."
+ Rule 4: Clearly distinguish the relationships among use cases, using "include" for mandatory interactions and "extend" for optional behavior.

Summary_rules:To help students effectively manage the modeling methodology for object-oriented class diagram design, I will first identify the incorrect and incomplete parts in the Student Answers based on the System Description and the Referenced Answer. I will then develop practical modeling rules to avoid these pitfalls in future projects.

### Identifying Incorrect and Incomplete Parts
1. **Use Case Naming Conventions**
   - **Incorrect/Incomplete:** "Check Remaining Tickets" and "Check Train Time" are used interchangeably.
   - **System Description Related Sentence:** The system describes specific operations: "check the remaining tickets and check the train time."
   - **Explanation:** The referenced answer uses a standardized naming convention, where "Check Tickets Schedule" is the appropriate term for train time. Students should be consistent with terminology.

2. **Actors Involved**
   - **Incorrect/Incomplete:** Some answers incorrectly include "System" or "Admin" as actors.
   - **System Description Related Sentence:** The only specified actor mentioned is "Customer."
   - **Explanation:** The system's focus is on the customer, and introducing additional actors not specified in the system description can create confusion.

3. **Use Case Relationships**
   - **Incorrect/Incomplete:** Relationship designs that do not reflect proper inclusion and extension practices, such as treating a ticket-checking query as an inclusion of the "Check Train Time" use case.
   - **System Description Related Sentence:** Passengers do queries by station or train number as a generalization and do not directly include them in the "Check Train Time" operation.
   - **Explanation:** Student answers should differentiate between inclusion (where one use case is part of another) and generalization (where one use case serves as a specialized version of another).

### Summary of Common Rules for Object-Oriented Modeling

Summarizing the findings and conclusions from incorrect and incomplete parts identified:

```rule
+ Rule 1: Always use consistent and descriptive names for use cases that align with the terminology found in the system description to avoid ambiguity.
+ Rule 2: Only include actors that are explicitly stated in the system description to maintain clarity in modeling.
+ Rule 3: Properly differentiate between use case relationships; use "include" to signify a definitive part of the process and "extend" for optional functionalities or variations.
+ Rule 4: Use generalization appropriately when a use case can be seen as a specialized version of another, rather than combining their functionality.
```

These rules provide general guidelines for any object-oriented modeling tasks and will help students to create accurate and coherent diagrams in future assignments.

---------------------3/10---------:
Summary_rules:To generate accurate and practical modeling rules, we'll first analyze the incorrect and incomplete parts of the student answers based on the provided system description and the referenced answer.

### Step 1: Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts

1. **Excessive Actors**: Several student answers incorrectly identified "System" as an actor. According to the system description, only "Customer" should be considered as an actor.
   
2. **Use Case Naming Inconsistencies**: The referenced answer uses "Check Tickets Schedule," while one of the student answers uses "Check Train Time." This could lead to confusion, as it is unclear which term should be used consistently.

3. **Association Type Misuse**: Some student answers incorrectly used "associate," which implies a different type of relationship than is suggested in the referenced answer. Specifically, the use of "include" and "extend" relationships are not correctly applied in some answers.

4. **Generalization Misapplication**: The generalization of "Query by Station" and "Query by Train Number" to "Query Tickets" was not applied by many students, which turned into an incomplete representation of the use cases.

### Step 2: Relevant Sentences from System Description

1. **Actors**: Only the "Customer" is referenced as an actor in the system description.
  
2. **Use Cases**: The system description specifies several functional methods indicating how the system operates, which should involve the specific naming used in the referenced answer.

3. **Relationships**: The correct use of "include" and "extend" and the generalization discussed clearly aligns with the functionalities described in the system functionality.

### Step 3: Explanation of Incorrect or Incomplete Parts

1. **Incorrect Actor Inclusion**: Including "System" as an actor is incorrect as it does not interact with the system's operations in the context of user-initiated actions.

2. **Use Case Naming**: Consistency in naming is crucial for clarity and understanding among various actors and use cases.

3. **Association Type Misapplication**: Misunderstanding "associate" versus "include" and "extend" indicates a lack of clarity regarding different types of transitions and relationships in modeling.

4. **Generalization Misapplication**: Failing to generalize "Query by Station" and "Query by Train Number" into a parent use case results in non-standardization of querying features.

### Step 4: Inductive Summarization of Common Rules

Based on the incorrect parts highlighted, here are the central modeling rules.

```rule
+ Rule 1: Clearly identify and define actors relevant to user interactions; avoid including system components that do not perform actions.
+ Rule 2: Maintain consistent naming conventions for use cases to ensure clarity and understanding; use the terminologies specified in the system description or referenced answers.
+ Rule 3: Correctly apply the relationships such as "include" and "extend" to describe how use cases interact meaningfully, rather than defaulting to "associate."
+ Rule 4: Utilize generalization appropriately to group similar use cases, fostering a clearer hierarchy and relationship within the model.
```

Improve_result:Based on the provided description, here is a structured format for a use case diagram for the train ticket booking system, adhering to the identified rules:

**Actors:**
- Customer

**Use Cases:**
- Log In
- Purchase Tickets
- Cancel Tickets
- Check Remaining Tickets
- Check Train Time
- Retrieve Password
- Query by Station
- Query by Train Number

**Associations:**

- (Customer) can (Cancel Tickets)
- (Customer) can (Check Remaining Tickets)
- (Customer) can (Retrieve Password)
- (Check Train Time) include (Query by Station)
- (Check Train Time) include (Query by Train Number)
- (Log In) extend (Retrieve Password)

This representation clearly defines the actors, use cases, and their associations while maintaining the guidelines for accurate modeling.
---------------------4/10---------:
Summary_rules:1. **Identifying Incorrect and Incomplete Parts:**
   - Students incorrectly used "associate" instead of the proper "can" terminology to describe the relationships between the Customer and use cases.
   - In some responses, they incorrectly used "extend" for relationships that should use "include."
   - Some use cases like "Check Remaining Tickets" are referenced but not clearly represented or described in terms of their relationship with login or other operations.
   - Confusion exists around categorizing queries as separate from ticket checking.

2. **Locating Sentences in System Description:**
   - "customers can purchase tickets, cancel tickets, check the remaining tickets and check the train time" indicates that all operations should be explicitly linked with the customer.
   - "the user must log in to the system first" clarifies that certain operations are dependent on the login, and it should be included in the associations properly.
   - "two ways to query the train time: station query and train number query" suggests that these querying options should be included under the same use case of checking train times rather than treated as separate use cases.

3. **Explanation of Incorrect or Incomplete Parts:**
   - Using "associate" does not accurately reflect the nature of the relationship; it's essential to express capabilities clearly with verbs like "can."
   - The use of "extend" instead of "include" can misrepresent the functionality; "include" should be used when one use case needs to be performed as part of another use case.
   - The mention of separate queries for checking time does not accurately capture the user flow; querying should be viewed as part of checking the schedule.

4. **Inductive Summary of Common Rules:**
   - Relationships should clearly express the capability or action a user can perform represented through appropriate verbs.
   - Use "include" when one use case is a necessary part of another use case and "extend" when there's optional functionality that may enhance a base use case.
   - Ensure that use cases that are linked to the same overarching functionality are grouped logically to eliminate redundancy and clarify user interactions.

5. **Outputting the Final Rules:**
```rule
+ Rule 1: Always use clear action verbs like "can" to describe relationships between actors and use cases.
+ Rule 2: Do not use "associate" to imply user capabilities; instead, properly categorize use case relationships as "can" for user actions.
+ Rule 3: Use "include" for relationships where one use case is essential within another, and reserve "extend" for optional behaviors that enhance a use case.
+ Rule 4: Group similar or dependent use cases to convey a clearer picture of the user's workflow and interactions.

---------------------5/10---------:
Summary_rules:Let's go through the steps to generate the rules for object-oriented modeling based on the student answers and the system description.

### Step 2: Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts in Student Answers

1. **Use Case Names:**
   - The student answers use different naming conventions for some use cases, such as "Check Remaining Tickets" and "Check Train Time," which deviate from the referenced answer terminology. Specifically, "Check Remaining Tickets" should be "Query Tickets," and "Check Train Time" should be "Check Tickets Schedule."
   - The use of both "Station Query" and "Train Number Query" as separate use cases rather than subclasses of "Query Tickets" is inconsistent with the given description.

2. **Relationships and Associations:**
   - The associations "Check Train Time" to "Station Query" and "Train Number Query" are described as "include" relationships, which is incorrect. These should be "generalize" relationships connected to "Query Tickets."
   - The relationship's directionality is inaccurately represented for the "Log in" use case. The "Log in" should not be included in "Purchase Ticket" or "Cancel Ticket" as these operations do not inherently include logging in but require it.

3. **Inclusion of System as Actor:**
   - The use of "System" as an actor in some answers is not warranted by the system description, which only mentions the "Customer" as an actor.

### Step 3: Locate Related Sentences in System Description

- **Incorrect Use Case Naming:**
  - "customers can purchase tickets, cancel tickets... check the remaining tickets... check the train time" suggests that the use case should encompass the functionality without breaking it down into too many specific queries.

- **Generalization and Inclusion Misunderstanding:**
  - "Whether it is to buy a ticket or cancel a ticket, the user must log in to the system first" indicates that logging in is a prerequisite but should not imply it as an "include" relationship.

- **Actor Clarification:**
  - The description solely states actions taken by "customers," and there is no mention of a "System" actor.

### Step 4: Inductively Summarize Common Rules for OO Modeling

1. Ensure consistent naming across use cases and adhere to the terminology specified in the system description to maintain clarity.
2. Use "include" relationships to denote mandatory dependencies between use cases, and reserve "generalize" relationships for cases where one use case serves as a refinement of another.
3. Avoid introducing unnecessary actors in the model; use only those specified in the system description.
4. Reflect requirements accurately by ensuring use cases capture the full scope of actions described, without breaking them down unnecessarily unless specified.

### Step 5: Final Rules

```rule
+ Rule 1: Ensure consistent naming of use cases as defined in the system description.
+ Rule 2: Use "include" relationships for mandatory dependencies and "generalize" for hierarchical refinement of use cases.
+ Rule 3: Include only actors that are explicitly mentioned in the system description.
+ Rule 4: Capture the full scope of actions within use cases without unnecessary divisions unless explicitly required.
```

---------------------6/10---------:
Summary_rules:To help students manage their modeling methodology effectively, let's analyze the student answers, identify the incorrect and incomplete parts, and then summarize useful rules for object-oriented modeling.

### Step 2: Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts

1. **Incorrect Use Case Names:**
   - Student answers use "Check Remaining Tickets" while the referenced answer indicates "Query Tickets." 

2. **Incorrect Relationship Types:**
   - The term "associate" is used instead of "can" for relationships.
   - The student answers have misapplied include/extend relationships in some cases (e.g., "Check Train Time" includes "Station Query" and "Train Number Query" instead of the correct generalization relationship).

3. **Missing Relationship Details:**
   - The "Log in" functionality should be included correctly to show that it is a required step for buying or canceling tickets.

### Step 3: Locate Related Sentences

1. **For Incorrect Use Case Names:**
   - From the System Description: "customers can purchase tickets, cancel tickets, check the remaining tickets and check the train time."
   - Explanation: The use case should be representative of the functionalities described in the system description.

2. **For Incorrect Relationship Types:**
   - From the Referenced Answer: "Customer can Purchase Tickets" indicates the use of "can" as a functional relationship rather than just "associate."
   - Explanation: The term "associate" is vague and doesn't accurately represent the actor's ability to perform a use case. 

3. **For Missing Relationship Details:**
   - From the System Description & Referenced Answer: The login functionality must be included with purchase and cancel operations.
   - Explanation: The system mandates that a user must be logged in to execute these actions, necessitating an accurate representation in the model.

### Step 4: Inductive Summary of Common Rules

Based on the identified errors and clarifications from the system description and referenced answers, we can derive the following practical modeling rules.

### Final Rules
```rule
+ Rule 1: Use terminology consistently from the system description to ensure use case names are accurate.
+ Rule 2: Clearly express relationships using appropriate verbs that indicate operations (e.g., "can," "include," "extend") rather than vague terms like "associate."
+ Rule 3: Represent constraints such as preconditions adequately through include or extend relationships to reflect dependencies between use cases.
+ Rule 4: Ensure all essential functionalities mentioned in the system description are captured in the use case diagram.
``` 

These rules will guide students towards accurate and practical object-oriented class diagram modeling practices across various domains.

Summary_rules:To help students manage object-oriented modeling methodology effectively, I will analyze the incorrect and incomplete parts of the student answers in relation to the system description and referenced answer. Subsequently, I will generate clear modeling rules based on the identified issues.

### Step 1: Identifying Incorrect and Incomplete Parts

1. **Actors Involvement**:
   - **Incorrect**: Some students included "System" as an actor.
   - **Correct**: Only "Customer" is cited as an actor based on the system description.

2. **Use Cases Specification**:
   - **Incomplete/Incorrect**: Use cases such as "Check Remaining Tickets" and the incorrect definition of "Check Train Time" were mentioned without clear relation to the system operations.
   - **Correct**: The referenced answer uses "Query Tickets" to encompass querying operations and divides it into specific queries (by station and train number).

3. **Use Case Relationships**:
   - **Incorrect**: The use case relationships in several answers used "associate" which is not appropriate in this context as it implies a weaker relationship compared to "include" or "extend".
   - **Correct**: The referenced answer properly utilized "include" and "extend" to demonstrate the connections between use cases and actors.

4. **Extension and Inclusion Relationships**:
   - **Incomplete**: Some answers treated "Log In" differently across various use cases, not representing it correctly as a prerequisite for ticket purchasing and cancellation.
   - **Correct**: The referenced answer clearly marks "log in" as a prerequisite for actions related to ticket purchases and cancellations.

### Step 2: Common Rules for OO Modeling

Based on the identified issues, the following general rules for object-oriented modeling can be derived:

```rule
+ Rule 1: Clearly identify and define all actors relevant to the system, ensuring that only active participants are included.
+ Rule 2: Use precise and meaningful names for use cases; they should align directly with stated system functionalities without redundancy.
+ Rule 3: Employ appropriate relationship types (such as "include," "extend," and "generalize") to accurately represent the interactions and dependencies between actors and use cases.
+ Rule 4: Maintain consistency in the relationships that govern sequential and conditional flow among use cases, ensuring that prerequisites (like logging in) are accurately reflected in their dependencies.
```

These rules are designed to guide students in creating clear and effective object-oriented models that accurately reflect the described systems and methodologies.

---------------------8/10---------:
Summary_rules:1. **Identifying Incorrect and Incomplete Parts:**
    - The expression "Check remaining tickets" is used in some student answers instead of "Query Tickets," which deviates from the system description and referenced answer.
    - There is a misunderstanding in using "associate" for relationships rather than specific relationships like "include" and "extend."
    - The term "System" is introduced as an actor, which is not part of the original system description and thus is incorrect.

2. **Locating Relevant Sentences:**
    - The phrase “check the remaining tickets” is not present in the system description, where “check tickets” was instead mentioned.
    - The system description emphasizes operations that are to be performed (e.g., purchasing tickets) and the requirement of user log-in before certain actions, which should be explicitly modeled using the correct relationships (include and extend).
    - There is reference to different ways to query train times, but there is no mention of the "System" as an actor.

3. **Explanation of Errors:**
    - Using "Check remaining tickets" instead of the correct term "Query Tickets" shows a lack of alignment with the provided system description, resulting in potential misunderstanding of functionality within the system.
    - Employing the term "associate" instead of specifying relationships (like "include" or "extend") does not accurately represent how use cases are interconnected, missing the essential behavior prescribed by the system.
    - The introduction of "System" as an actor is inaccurate as the focus should be solely on the "Customer" as the user executing the operations.

4. **Summarizing Common Rules for OO Modeling:**
    - Ensure that terminology used aligns precisely with the provided system description to avoid misinterpretation of functionalities.
    - Clearly define relationships between actors and use cases using specific terms (like include and extend) rather than generic terms like associate.
    - Avoid introducing elements that are not specified in the system description, ensuring that the model reflects only the components described.

5. **Final Rules Output:**
```rule
+ Rule 1: Use precise terminology that aligns with the system description to represent functionalities accurately.
+ Rule 2: Define relationships using specific terms (like include, extend, generalize) rather than generic terms like associate.
```

This format appropriately represents the functionalities of the system while aligning with the specified rules and addressing the common rules for object-oriented modeling.
---------------------9/10---------:
Summary_rules:1. **Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts in Student Answers:**
   - The term “Check Remaining Tickets” is inconsistent with the system description, which specifies operations like "check the remaining tickets" but does not define it as a distinct use case. The accurate term for such functionality should align more closely with “Query Tickets.”
   - Additionally, the inclusion relationships for checking the train time (i.e., "Check Train Time" include "Station Query" and "Train Number Query") are inaccurately portrayed. The system allows for direct queries but does not define that as an extension of the check.
   - Extending the Login use case with Retrieve Password in both answers deviates from the proper use of the extend relationship. Retrieve Password should be correctly described as an extension that is invoked under specific circumstances.

2. **Locate Sentences in System Description:**
   - **Related to Check Remaining Tickets:**
     - No direct mention of "Check Remaining Tickets" exists. The system description indicates that users can check tickets, therefore it’s more accurate to refer to it as “Query Tickets.”
   - **Related to Check Train Time vs Station Query:**
     - The system description states that customers can check the "train time" through two methods: "station query" or "train number query," implying that these are separate queries rather than extensions of checking time.
   - **Related to Retrieve Password:**
     - The description states, “If you forget your password when logging in to the system, you can also retrieve your password,” indicating that Retrieve Password is an ancillary feature but not a logical extension of the login use case.

3. **Explain Why Each Part is Incorrect or Incomplete:**
   - **Check Remaining Tickets:** Referring to it as a distinct use case misrepresents functionality because the system emphasizes querying rather than just checking remaining tickets.
   - **Relationships for Train Queries:** Misusing the include relationship effectively changes the nature of the queries into dependent processes, while they should be stand-alone actions users can take.
   - **Login and Retrieve Password:** Describing Retrieve Password as an extension incorrectly presents user interaction because it's a recovery option available during the login process under specific circumstances, rather than a general extension.

4. **Inductively Summarize Common Rules for OO Modeling:**
   - Use cases must be accurately defined based on the provided system functionalities to reflect user actions.
   - Relationships between actors and use cases must correctly express the dependencies and flow of actions, especially regarding whether to use include, extend, or generalization.
   - Ensure clarity in how operations relate to one another, particularly distinguishing between different types of queries and associated processes.

5. **Final Oj rule output:**
```rule
+ Rule 1: Clearly define use cases based on system functionalities, ensuring alignment with the stated operations.
+ Rule 2: Do not misrepresent relationships between use cases; ensure that include and extend relationships are used accurately and reflect the true nature of the interactions.

- **Use Cases:** The use cases accurately reflect the functionalities of the system, including actions for purchasing, canceling tickets, querying tickets, checking train times, and handling password retrieval.
- **Associations:** The associations show the relationships between the customer and the various use cases. Notably, "Check Train Time" includes "Station Query" and "Train Number Query" as different methods to check the train time. "Retrieve Password" is accurately represented as an extension of the Login process, highlighting its conditional relationship.

This format adheres to the rules outlined, ensuring clarity and correctness in the representation of the system functionalities and relationships.
---------------------10/10---------:
Summary_rules:1. **Identify Incorrect and Incomplete Parts**
   - **Incorrect Actors**: The inclusion of "System" as an actor is not justified, as it is not a user or an external entity interacting with the system.
   - **Incomplete Use Cases**: The student answers contain mislabeling or missing crucial interactions. For instance, "Check Remaining Tickets" is directly related to "Query Tickets" in the referenced answer.
   - **Incorrect Relationships**: The relationships "extend" and "include" are used improperly. For example, the interactions related to logging in should be an "include" rather than an "extend" relationship.
   - **Misclassification of Queries**: The student answers incorrectly treat "Station Query" and "Train Number Query" as separate use cases without the proper generalization relationship shown in the referenced answer.

2. **Locate Sentences in System Description**
   - *Actors*: The system description does not mention "System" as an actor, only indicating that "customers" perform operations.
   - *Use Cases*: The description implies essential tasks related to ticket management and time inquiries but does not require specific terminology used by the student answers.
   - *Relationships*: The operations requiring a logged-in user are specified, indicating an inclusion relationship rather than extending the login function.

3. **Explain Why Each Part is Incorrect or Incomplete**
   - **"System" as an Actor**: The task is user-centered and requires representing users (customers). The system is not an actor; it provides functionalities.
   - **"Check Remaining Tickets"**: This should be encompassed under a broader use case such as "Query Tickets," which captures all ticket-related inquiries, thereby providing a more organized structure.
   - **Relationships**: Use cases requiring prior actions (i.e., logging in) should incorporate "include" to maintain clarity on prerequisites. Extending implies optional behavior, which is not true for login functions that are prerequisites.

4. **Inductively Summarize Common Rules for OO Modeling**
   - **Actors** should represent external entities that interact directly with the system, generally users or other systems.
   - **Use Cases** should be defined clearly without unnecessary subdivisions unless absolutely necessary for clarity or function.
   - **Relationships** should accurately reflect the nature of interactions; "include" indicates dependency and mandatory actions, whereas "extend" should imply optional enhancements.
   - **Generalization** should be utilized to consolidate similar use cases for clarity and efficiency in representation.

5. **Ensure Clarity and Applicability**
   - Modeling rules should be articulated in a straightforward manner that facilitates understanding and application in varied scenarios.

```rule
+ Rule 1: Use only relevant external entities as actors; avoid including the system itself as an actor.
+ Rule 2: Group related functionalities under broader use cases instead of breaking them into excessive specifics.
+ Rule 3: Utilize "include" relationships for mandatory dependent actions, and only use "extend" for optional enhancements.
+ Rule 4: Apply generalization where applicable to simplify and categorize related use cases effectively.
```

Improve_result:Based on the provided description and the specified rules for creating use case diagrams, here is the structured use case diagram:

**Actors:**
- Customer

**Use Cases:**
- Log In
- Purchase Ticket
- Cancel Ticket
- Query Tickets
  - Station Query
  - Train Number Query
- Retrieve Password
- Check Train Time

**Associations:**
- (Customer) can (Log In)
- (Customer) can (Purchase Ticket)
- (Customer) can (Cancel Ticket)
- (Customer) can (Query Tickets)
- (Query Tickets) include (Station Query)
- (Query Tickets) include (Train Number Query)
- (Customer) can (Retrieve Password)
- (Log In) include (Retrieve Password)
- (Purchase Ticket) include (Log In)
- (Cancel Ticket) include (Log In)
- (Check Train Time) include (Query Tickets)

### Explanation:
1. **Actors**: "Customer" is the only relevant external entity required for interactions with the system, aligning with Rule 1.
  
2. **Use Cases**: The use cases are defined broadly enough to encompass related functionalities while avoiding unnecessary subdivisions as emphasized in Rule 2. The broader term "Query Tickets" encapsulates both "Station Query" and "Train Number Query" as sub-use cases.

3. **Relationships**:
   - "Log In," "Purchase Ticket," and "Cancel Ticket" include a dependency on needing a prior action (logging in), thus using the "include" relationship appropriately per Rule 3.
   - The "Retrieve Password" functionality is tied to "Log In," necessitating its inclusion in that process.
   - The "Query Tickets" use case appropriately encapsulates both querying methods.

4. **Generalization**: The structure employs a clear hierarchy between broader and specific use cases (especially the queries), maintaining clarity without unnecessary complexity in representation per Rule 4. 

This use case diagram structure aims for clarity and adheres to the defined rules for effective object-oriented modeling.
