- The photocopier starts in the "Idle" state.
- It transitions to "Copying" upon receiving a copy order.
- If it detects no paper during copying, it transitions to "PaperShortage."
- If a paper jam is detected during copying, it transitions to "PaperJam."
- After completing the copy process successfully, it goes back to "Idle."
- In the "PaperShortage" state, after loading paper, it returns to "Idle."
- In the "PaperJam" state, once the fault is resolved, it also returns to "Idle."
