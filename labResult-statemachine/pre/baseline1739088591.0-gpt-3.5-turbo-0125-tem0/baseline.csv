### Additional Notes:
1. The `WaitingToDial` state can transition to itself when the handset is picked up, indicating that it's ready to receive dial input.
2. A `timeoutEvent` will be triggered if the user does not dial within 30 seconds.
3. The transition from `Dialing` to `Connecting` is conditional based on whether the dialing is correct.
4. After successfully connecting, it can branch into either `Busy` or `Connected` states depending on the engagement status of the other party.
5. The transition from `Connected` to `Talking` occurs when the other party picks up the phone.
6. The `Hanging` state represents the conclusion of the call when the other party hangs up or hangs up during the conversation.

3. If the dialing is successful (correct), the system transitions to the "Connecting" state.
4. If the dialing is not completed within 30 seconds, the phone enters the "Timeout" state.
5. In the "Connecting" state:
   - If the other party is engaged, the state changes to "Busy."
   - If the other party answers, it transitions to "Talking."
6. If the other party hangs up, the machine transitions to the "Hanging" state from either the "Busy" or "Talking" states.
