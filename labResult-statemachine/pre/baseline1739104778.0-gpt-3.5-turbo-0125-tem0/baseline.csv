Base_AI_answer:Based on the provided description, here is a state machine diagram that outlines the states, events, and transitions:

### States:
+ Off
+ WaterCheck
+ On
+ Broken
+ Terminated

### Events:
+ turnOnSwitch
+ waterAvailable
+ waterNotAvailable
+ heaterBroken
+ completeBoiling

### Transitions:
+ Off (turnOnSwitch) WaterCheck
+ WaterCheck (waterAvailable) On
+ WaterCheck (waterNotAvailable) Terminated
+ On (heaterBroken) Broken
+ On (completeBoiling) Terminated

### Explanation:
1. The **Off** state indicates the starting point where the burner is not active.
2. On turning on the switch, the system moves to the **WaterCheck** state to assess if water is available.
3. If water is available, the system transitions to the **On** state, where boiling occurs.
4. In the **On** state, if the heater is broken at any point, the system shifts to the **Broken** state.
5. If no water is found during the **WaterCheck**, the process directly moves to the **Terminated** state.
6. When boiling is complete, or if the boiling process is interrupted by any malfunction, the system transitions to the **Terminated** state.

+ CheckingWater (waterAvailable) Heating  
+ Heating (startHeating) Boiling  
+ Boiling (waterBoiling) Boiling  
+ Boiling (heaterBroken) Broken  
+ Broken (stopBoiling) Off  

### Explanation:
1. The initial state is **Off** where the water burner is not active.
2. When the switch is turned on (event: **turnOn**), it transitions to **CheckingWater** to ensure there's water in the kettle.
3. If water is available (event: **waterAvailable**), it transitions to the **Heating** state where the burner performs its function.
4. Once heating starts (event: **startHeating**), it transitions to **Boiling**.
5. In the **Boiling** state, if the water is boiling (event: **waterBoiling**), it remains in the **Boiling** state, continuing to boil water.
6. If the heater is broken (event: **heaterBroken**), the process transitions to the **Broken** state.
7. Finally, in the **Broken** state, there’s an event to stop boiling (event: **stopBoiling**) that returns the burner back to the **Off** state.

This structured representation outlines the states, events, and transitions clearly!

### Transitions:
+ Off (turnOn) checkWater
+ checkWater (waterPresent) Open

- In the **checkWater** state, if there is water present, the state transitions to **Open** and the boiling process can begin.
- If there is no water, the state remains in **Off**.
- While in the **Open** state, the event **boil** maintains the state in **Open**.
- If the event **waterHeaterBroken** occurs while in the **Open** state, the state transitions to **Broken**.
- After the **Broken** state, the **terminateProcess** event will transition the state back to **Off**. 

This structure encapsulates the entire process of boiling water, handling the presence of water and the operational state of the water heater.

3. In the **Open** state, the **CheckWater** event occurs to check if there is water in the kettle. If water exists, it transitions to **Boiling**.
4. In the **Boiling** state, the process continues as long as the water heater is functioning, indicated by the **BoilWater** event, which keeps it in the **Boiling** state.
5. If the **WaterHeaterBroken** event occurs while in the **Boiling** state, it transitions to **Terminated**, indicating a halt in the boiling process due to a malfunction.
6. If there is **NoWater** checked during the **Open** state, it also transitions to **Terminated**, indicating that the process cannot proceed without water.

### Explanation of the State Machine:
- **Off**: The initial state when the water burner is off. It transitions to **Ready** when the switch is turned on.
- **Ready**: This state indicates that the burner is ready to check for water. If water is present, it transitions to **Boiling**.
- **Boiling**: In this state, the water is being heated. If the heater is detected as broken, it transitions to **Broken**. If the water is boiled successfully, it transitions to **Terminated**.
- **Broken**: This state signifies the heater is broken, and the process is terminated here.
- **Terminated**: This is a terminal state indicating the boiling water process has ended, whether due to successful boiling or a broken water heater. 

This structured representation helps in visualizing the state transitions and the conditions for each state within the boiling water process.

+ StartBoiling
+ HeaterBroken

### Transitions:
+ Off (TurnOn) Checking
+ Checking (CheckWater) On
+ On (WaterPresent) Boiling
+ On (WaterAbsent) Terminated
+ Boiling (HeaterBroken) Terminated

### Diagram Summary:
1. **Off**: Initial state of the water burner.
   - **Event**: TurnOn → leads to **Checking** state.
  
2. **Checking**: The burner checks if there is water in the kettle.
   - **Event**: CheckWater → leads to **On** if water is present, or to **Terminated** if no water is found.

3. **On**: Water burner is operational and waits for the boiling process.
   - **Event**: WaterPresent → leads to **Boiling** state.
   - **Event**: WaterAbsent → leads to **Terminated** state.

4. **Boiling**: The state where water is being boiled.
   - **Event**: HeaterBroken → leads to **Terminated** state.

5. **Terminated**: The end state where the boiling process is halted due to various reasons.

This state machine effectively captures the flow and transitions of the water boiling process as described.

### Note:
- The "CheckWater" event checks for the presence of water and transitions to the "Open" state if water is present. If no water is present, you may want to consider adding another transition for that scenario or additional handling. In this model, it's assumed water is present for the transition to proceed.
- The transition from "Open" to "Broken" indicates that the water heater could fail even when in the "Open" state.
- The "Terminated" state indicates the end of the boiling process when the heater is broken or when boiling is stopped.

3. From **WaterAvailable**, when the water burner switch is turned on, transition to the **Open** state.
4. In the **Open** state, if a **HeaterBroken** event occurs, transition to the **Terminated** state.
5. From **Open**, if the process is still ongoing and another **TurnOnSwitch** event occurs, transition to the **Boiling** state.

The state machine begins with the burner in the "Off" state. When the user turns on the burner, it checks for water. If water is present, the state transitions to "Boiling." However, if at any point the water heater is found to be broken while boiling, the state transitions to "Broken." The boiling process can also be stopped, reverting the state back to "Off." If there is no water present during the check, it also goes back to "Off."

2. **Event to Turn On**: When the **turnOn** event occurs, the state transitions from **Off** to **Open**.
3. **Check for Water**: In the **Open** state, the system checks for water availability. If water is present, the state remains **Open**.
4. **Start Boiling**: The process continues in the **Open** state while the water is boiling.
5. **Breakdown Condition**: If the **waterHeaterBroken** event occurs during boiling, the state transitions from **Open** to **Terminated**.
6. **Stopping the Process**: Once in the **Terminated** state, if a **stopBoiling** event occurs, it returns to the **Off** state.

2. **On**: The state where the burner is activated, and a check for water is performed.
3. **Boiling**: The state where the water is boiling.
4. **Broken**: A failure state where the water heater has malfunctioned.

- Transitions are defined based on the events that occur, leading to a change in states.
- The check for water must happen after turning on the burner, and if there is no water, it transitions back to Off.
- If the water heater breaks while boiling, the state transitions to Broken.
