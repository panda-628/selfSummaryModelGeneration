+ Rule 1: Always include all relevant classes that represent distinct entities in the system, ensuring that their purpose is clear and their attributes are well-defined.
+ Rule 2: Relationships between classes must accurately reflect the cardinality and directionality based on the operational requirements of the system, avoiding inappropriate associations that misrepresent the functional interactions.
