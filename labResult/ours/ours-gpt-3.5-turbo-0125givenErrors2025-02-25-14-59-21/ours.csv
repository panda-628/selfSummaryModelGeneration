Summary_rules:```rule
+ Rule 1: Use consistent naming and casing for enumerations, ensuring they convey the model's intent clearly and avoid ambiguity.
+ Rule 2: Ensure that each class captures all necessary attributes relevant to its role while maintaining appropriate visibility levels for encapsulation; avoid omitting important properties.
+ Rule 3: Define methods where applicable to illustrate the behavior associated with each class, thereby enhancing the model's richness and functionality.
+ Rule 4: Accurately represent relationships between classes, specifying cardinality and direction clearly to reflect the true associations in the system being modeled.
+ Rule 5: Utilize clear and uniform relationship labels across the model to maintain consistency and enhance understanding of interactions between entities.

### Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **Enumerations**: 
   - The `Interval` enumeration defines the possible intervals for repeating tests.

2. **Classes**:
   - `Doctor`: Represents a doctor with attributes for their practitioner number, contact information, and signature. They can make requisitions and view test results.
   - `Patient`: Represents a patient with personal information and methods to book or cancel appointments.
   - `Lab`: Represents a lab with its attributes, including business hours and fees, and a method to get available appointments.
   - `Requisition`: Represents the requisition, linking it to the doctor and the tests it contains, as well as attributes for repetition.
   - `Test`: Represents medical tests with details about duration, type, and whether an appointment is required.
   - `Appointment`: Represents an appointment made by a patient, including essential details like confirmation numbers and times.
   - `TestResult`: Represents the result of a test including the result string and accompanying report.

3. **Relationships**:
   - The relationships between classes are clearly defined with cardinalities depicting how many instances can exist for each class in relation to another.
   - The arrows and labels indicate the nature of each relationship, such as a doctor creating requisitions, patients making appointments at labs, and requisitions showing test results.
