### Explanation of the Diagram:

- **Classes:**
  - `Doctor`: Represents a doctor with attributes for practitioner number, signature, full name, address, phone number, and the date from which their requisition is valid. The method `prescribeTest()` allows the doctor to prescribe a test.
  
  - `Patient`: Holds patient information such as health number, name, date of birth, address, and phone number, with a method to make appointments.
  
  - `Test`: Represents individual tests, associated with a duration and type (using the `TestType` enum).
  
  - `Requisition`: Contains a patient, a doctor, a list of tests, and details about repeat counts and intervals. It also has a method to view results.
  
  - `Appointment`: People can create appointments, with attributes like confirmation number and timing, as well as a relationship with the `Lab` class.
  
  - `Lab`: Stores information about the lab, including its name, registration number, address, business hours, and fees.

- **Enumerations:**
  - `TestType`: Enum for different types of tests.
  - `RepeatingInterval`: Enum representing possible intervals for test repetitions.

- **Relationships:**
  - A doctor creates one or more requisitions, while a patient can make one or more requisitions.
  - A requisition can include multiple tests.
  - A patient can book appointments, which are associated with a specific lab.
