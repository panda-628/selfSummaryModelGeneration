```
### Notes:
1. **Doctor** and **Patient** classes have attributes related to their personal information. The doctor has a list of requisitions they've created, while the patient has a list of appointments they've made.
2. **Requisition** contains multiple **Test** objects and holds details about the tests that need to be performed for that patient.
3. **Appointment** is associated with a **Lab** and is linked to a specific **Requisition** through the patient making the appointment.
4. **Lab** contains information about its business hours, fees, and which types of tests it can provide.
5. **TestGroup** is used to manage groups of tests that can be combined on one requisition.
6. The enumerations define various types and statuses used throughout the classes to represent specific states or types in the application.
---------------------2/10---------2/5:
Base_AI_answer:Based on the provided description, here is the class diagram represented in the specified format.

### Enumerations:
```

```

### Relationships:
```
1 Doctor associate 0..* Requisition
1 Patient associate 1..* Requisition
1 Requisition contain 1..* Test
1 Doctor inherit 0..* Doctor // A doctor can prescribe for another doctor, but not for themselves
1 Requisition contain 1..* Appointment
1 Lab contain 0..* Appointment
1 Test associate 0..1AppointmentType
```

### Note:
1. The `Doctor` class can have a self-referential relationship to accommodate the fact that a doctor can prescribe tests for another doctor. This is denoted as an inheritance relationship.
2. The relationship between `Requisition` and `Test` indicates that a requisition can contain multiple tests and that these tests need to belong to the same group.
3. An `Appointment` is associated with a `Lab`, which allows linking specific appointments to the lab where the test will be performed.
4. The use of lists or collections (like `List<Test>`) is implied in the attributes that may have multiple items.

### Explanation:
1. **Enumerations** are defined to categorize types of tests and the frequency of repetitions for tests.
2. **Classes** represent key entities in the system, with attributes defining their characteristics:
   - `Doctor` has details including a digital signature.
   - `Patient` encapsulates patient information.
   - `Requisition` encompasses a doctor’s order for tests linked to a patient.
   - `Test` represents the various tests that can be requisitioned.
   - `Lab` contains information about testing labs, including business hours and fees.
   - `Appointment` includes details on booked appointments associated with a requisition.
3. **Relationships** show how these classes interact with one another:
   - A doctor can create multiple requisitions.
   - A patient can also be associated with multiple requisitions.
   - A requisition can contain multiple tests but requires that the tests belong to the same type (group of tests).
   - A lab can be associated with multiple appointments, but an appointment corresponds to exactly one requisition.

1 Lab associate 0..* Appointment
```

### Inheritance:
No inheritance relationships exist in this description.

### Composition:
```
1 Lab contain 0..* Appointment
```

### Notes:
- The `Requisition` class contains references to multiple `Test` objects, and optionally to a `RepetitionInfo` for repeated tests.
- The `Doctor` class ensures that a doctor cannot prescribe a test for themselves based on the `isForSelf` attribute in the `Requisition` class.
- The `Appointment` class connects `Requisition` and `Lab` with specific attributes related to the appointment details.
---------------------6/10---------4/5:
Base_AI_answer:Based on the provided description of the LabTracker software, here's a structured representation of the classes, enumerations, and the relationships in a class diagram format.

### Enumerations:
``` 
RepetitionPattern(Weekly, Monthly, EveryHalfYear, Yearly)
TestType(BloodTest, Ultrasound, XRay, UrineTest, StoolTest)
```

### Classes:
```
Doctor(practitionerNumber : int, signature : Image, fullName : String, address : String, phoneNumber : String, requisitionValidityDate : Date)
Patient(healthNumber : String, firstName : String, lastName : String, dateOfBirth : Date, address : String, phoneNumber : String)
Requisition(validityDate : Date, tests : List<Test>, patient : Patient, doctor : Doctor)
Test(name : String, testType : TestType, duration : int, isWalkInOnly : boolean, requiresSampleDropOff : boolean)
Appointment(confirmationNumber : String, appointmentDate : Date, startTime : Time, endTime : Time, lab : Lab)
Lab(name : String, registrationNumber : String, address : String, businessHours : Map<DayOfWeek, TimeRange>, fee : double)

1 Requisition contain 1..* Test
1 Patient associate 0..* Requisition
1 Requisition contain 0..1 Appointment
1 Lab contain 0..* Appointment
0..1 Appointment associate 0..* Test
```

### Additional Considerations:

- Doctors can prescribe tests to other patients as well, including other doctors. This is captured by the associations between doctors, patients, and requisitions.
- Each test is characterized by its type (blood test, ultrasound, etc.), and the relationships encapsulate the constraints and properties associated with each type of test, particularly regarding appointments (i.e., walk-in only tests).
- The `Appointment` class comprehensively represents the nature of appointments with confirmation details, dates, and lab information.
- The `Requisition` class contains multiple tests with a check to ensure only tests of the same type can be combined.
- Business hours and fees for the lab demonstrate the flexibility in lab operations, ensuring that no time slots are overlapping with fee details being reflected.

This structured diagram highlights all the critical aspects from the description while adhering to the principles of class and relationship modeling in UML.

The applicability of the inheritance (`Doctor inherit Patient`) in this scenario may not accurately reflect real-world roles or system design. However, it is placed here according to the initial requirement; further enhancement would likely treat `Doctor` and `Patient` as distinct entities.
---------------------7/10---------1/5:
Base_AI_answer:Based on the provided description of the LabTracker software, here is the class diagram using the specified format:

### Enumerations:
```plaintext
TestType(bloodTest, ultrasound, xRay, urineSample, stoolSample)
RepetitionInterval(weekly, monthly, halfYearly, yearly)
```

### Classes:
```plaintext
Doctor(practitionerNumber: String, fullName: String, address: String, phoneNumber: String, digitalSignature: Image, validFromDate: Date)
Patient(healthNumber: String, firstName: String, lastName: String, dateOfBirth: Date, address: String, phoneNumber: String)
Requisition(requisitionID: String, doctor: Doctor, patient: Patient, tests: List<Test>, repetitionPattern: RepetitionInterval, repetitions: int)
Test(testID: String, testType: TestType, duration: int, isAppointmentRequired: Boolean)
Appointment(appointmentID: String, requisition: Requisition, lab: Lab, confirmationNumber: String, date: Date, startTime: Time, endTime: Time)
Lab(labName: String, registrationNumber: String, address: String, businessHours: String, changeFee: Float)
```

### Relationships:
```plaintext
1 Doctor prescribe 0..* Requisition
0..* Requisition contain 1..* Test
1 Patient make 0..* Appointment
1 Appointment belongsTo 1 Lab
1 Lab has 0..* Appointment
0..* Requisition has 0..* Test(
    for the same group, e.g., all blood tests or all ultrasound examinations
)
``` 

### Additional Notes:
- The `Doctor` cannot prescribe tests for themselves which can potentially be indicated with an additional validation mechanism within business logic but does not require additional attributes or relationships in this diagram.
- The relationship between the `Test` and `Requisition` classes is defined to ensure that all tests in a requisition are from the same group, which might also be implemented in software logic rather than in design here.
- Data types such as `String`, `Date`, `Image`, and `Time` are assumed as primitive or standard types for the context of this diagram.
- `List<Test>` in `Requisition` implies that multiple instances of `Test` can be associated with a single `Requisition` but does so in a manner that respects the grouping of tests as mentioned.

Base_AI_answer:Based on the provided description, here is the class diagram representation using enumerations, classes, and relationships:

### Enumerations:
```plaintext
TestType(bloodTest, ultrasound, xRay, urineSample, stoolSample)
RepetitionInterval(weekly, monthly, everyHalfYear, yearly)
AppointmentStatus(confirmed, canceled, changed)
```

### Classes:
```plaintext
Doctor(practitionerNumber : int, fullName : String, address : String, phoneNumber : String, signature : Image, requisitionValidityDate : Date)
Patient(healthNumber : String, firstName : String, lastName : String, dateOfBirth : Date, address : String, phoneNumber : String)
Requisition(requisitionDate : Date, tests : List<Test>, doctor : Doctor, patient : Patient, repetitionCount : int, repetitionInterval : RepetitionInterval)
Test(name : String, duration : Duration, testType : TestType)
Lab(name : String, address : String, registrationNumber : String, businessHours : String, appointmentRequired : boolean, fee : double)

Base_AI_answer:Here’s a class diagram representation based on the provided description:

**Enumerations:**
```
RepetitionInterval(Weekly, Monthly, HalfYear, Yearly)
TestType(BloodTest, UltrasoundExamination, XRay, UrineSample, StoolSample)
AppointmentStatus(Confirmed, Changed, Canceled)
```

**Classes:**
```
Doctor(practitionerNumber : String, signature : Image, fullName : String, address : String, phoneNumber : String, dateValidFrom : Date)
Patient(healthNumber : String, firstName : String, lastName : String, dateOfBirth : Date, address : String, phoneNumber : String)
Requisition(requisitionId : String, doctor : Doctor, patient : Patient, tests : List<Test>, repeatCount : int, repetitionInterval : RepetitionInterval)

Lab(name : String, registrationNumber : String, address : String, businessHours : Schedule, appointmentFee : Decimal)
Appointment(confirmationNumber : String, appointmentDate : Date, startTime : Time, endTime : Time, lab : Lab, status : AppointmentStatus)
```

**Relationships:**
```
1 Doctor associate 0..* Requisition
1 Patient associate 0..* Requisition
1 Requisition contain 1..* Test
1 Lab associate 0..* Appointment
0..1 Appointment associate 0..1 Requisition
```

**Explanations:**

- **Enumerations** define the possible values for specific attributes, such as the types of test, intervals for scheduling repeated tests, and statuses of appointments.
  
- **Classes** represent entities with specific attributes as described in your scenario, such as `Doctor`, `Patient`, `Requisition`, `Test`, `Lab`, and `Appointment`.

- **Relationships** indicate how classes are associated with each other, like a `Doctor` can have multiple requisitions, and a `Requisition` can contain multiple `Test` instances. Each `Lab` can have multiple `Appointment` instances and each appointment is related to a requisition.

This structure captures the essence and relationships of the described system in the class diagram format.
---------------------8/10---------1/5:
Base_AI_answer:Based on the provided description of the LabTracker software, I have created a class diagram structure, including the necessary enumerations, classes, and relationships. Here is the specification:

Enumerations:
```
TestInterval(weekly, monthly, halfYear, yearly)
TestType(bloodTest, ultrasound, xRay, other)
AppointmentStatus(confirmed, canceled, rescheduled)
```

Classes:
```
Doctor(practitionerNumber : String, signature : Image, fullName : String, address : String, phoneNumber : String, dateValidFrom : Date)
Patient(healthNumber : String, firstName : String, lastName : String, dateOfBirth : Date, address : String, phoneNumber : String)
Requisition(date : Date, tests : List<Test>, patient : Patient, doctor : Doctor, repeatTimes : Int, interval : TestInterval)
Test(duration : Int, type : TestType)
Lab(name : String, registrationNumber : String, address : String, businessHours : String, appointmentFee : Double)
Appointment(confirmationNumber : String, date : Date, startTime : Time, endTime : Time, status : AppointmentStatus, lab : Lab, patient : Patient, requisition : Requisition)
```

Relationships:
```
1 Doctor associate 0..* Requisition
1 Patient associate 0..* Requisition
0..* Requisition contain 1..* Test
1 Lab contain 0..* Appointment
1 Appointment associate 1 Patient
1 Appointment associate 1 Requisition
1 Requisition inherit Doctor
```

### Explanation of Relationships:
1. **Doctor to Requisition:** A doctor can create multiple requisitions, but each requisition is associated with one specific doctor.
2. **Patient to Requisition:** A patient can have multiple requisitions (e.g., over time), and each requisition is linked to one patient.
3. **Requisition to Test:** A requisition can contain multiple tests but each test is assigned to a single requisition.
4. **Lab to Appointment:** A lab can have multiple appointments, which are scheduled for various patients.
5. **Appointment to Patient:** Each appointment is linked to a specific patient.
6. **Appointment to Requisition:** Each appointment is associated with a specific requisition that links to the tests the patient is undergoing.

This structure encapsulates the core elements of the system while considering the relationships and constraints provided in the description.
---------------------8/10---------2/5:

AppointmentStatus(confirmed, changed, canceled)
```

### Classes:
```plaintext
Doctor(practitionerNumber : int, fullName : String, address : String, phoneNumber : String, signature : Image, validFrom : Date)
Patient(healthNumber : String, firstName : String, lastName : String, dateOfBirth : Date, address : String, phoneNumber : String)
Test(testType : TestType, duration : int)

1 Requisition inherit 0..1 Patient
```

### Notes on Relationships:
- A **Doctor** can create multiple **Requisitions**, but a **Requisition** must be associated with exactly one **Doctor**.
- A **Patient** can have multiple **Requisitions**, but each **Requisition** corresponds to exactly one **Patient**.
- A **Requisition** can contain multiple **Tests**, and each **Test** can belong to multiple **Requisitions** but each **Requisition** can only contain **Tests** of the same type.
- **Appointments** are tied to **Tests**, where each **Test** can lead to multiple **Appointments**, though some tests may not require an appointment.
- Each **Lab** can have zero or more **Appointments** associated with its services.
- The inheritance relationship for **Requisition** and **Patient** is optional per the requirements described (specifically, **Doctor** cannot prescribe to themselves).

This structure captures the key elements and relationships outlined in the description, facilitating an understanding of how these classes interact within the system.
---------------------8/10---------4/5:
Base_AI_answer:Based on the provided description, we can derive the following class diagram with appropriate enumerations, classes, and relationships.

### Enumerations:
1. RepetitionInterval (WEEKLY, MONTHLY, HALF_YEAR, YEARLY)
2. TestType (BLOOD_TEST, ULTRASOUND, XRAY, URINE_TEST, STOOL_TEST)
3. AppointmentStatus (CONFIRMED, CANCELED, PENDING)

### Classes:
1. Doctor(practitionerNumber : int, signature : Image, fullName : String, address : String, phoneNumber : String, validFrom : Date)
2. Patient(healthNumber : String, firstName : String, lastName : String, dateOfBirth : Date, address : String, phoneNumber : String)
3. Requisition(requisitionId : int, doctor : Doctor, patient : Patient, testGroup : TestType, repetitionInterval : RepetitionInterval, repetitions : int)
4. Test(testId : int, name : String, duration : int, testType : TestType, isAppointmentRequired : boolean, isWalkInOnly : boolean)
5. Appointment(appointmentId : int, requisition : Requisition, lab : Lab, confirmationNumber : int, appointmentDate : Date, startTime : Time, endTime : Time, status : AppointmentStatus)
6. Lab(labId : int, name : String, registrationNumber : String, address : String, businessHours : String, cancellationFee : float)

### Relationships:
1. 1 Doctor associate 0..* Requisition
2. 1 Patient associate 0..* Requisition
3. 1 Requisition contain 0..* Test
4. 1 Requisition associate 1..* Appointment
5. 1 Appointment associate 1 Lab
6. 0..* Test associate 1 Requisition (Test can belong to only one Requisition as part of its group)

### Notes:
- The `Requisition` class combines multiple tests but ensures they are of the same `TestType`.
- The appointment system integrates with both the Patient and Lab, enabling scheduling and management of appointments.
- The `RepetitionInterval` in `Requisition` allows for specifying how tests are repeated, affecting scheduling.

---------------------8/10---------5/5:
Base_AI_answer:Based on the provided description, here’s a structured class diagram representation including enumerations, classes, and relationships.

### Enumerations:
```
RepetitionInterval(weekly, monthly, halfYear, yearly)

1 Appointment associate 1 Requisition
1 Lab associate 0..* Appointment
```

### Composition Relationships:
```
1 Requisition contain 1..* Test
1 Lab contain 0..* Appointment
```

### Notes:
- `Doctor` and `Patient` are represented with basic attributes and linked to the `Requisition` class.
- `Requisition` contains a list of `Test` objects which can be of any `TestType` defined by the enumeration.
- The relationships mark how many instances of one class can be associated with another, such as a doctor can create multiple requisitions, and each requisition can involve multiple tests.
- `Appointment` class captures the details required for scheduling an appointment which is tied to both the patient and the lab.
- `RepetitionInterval` handles the frequency of how often tests need to be repeated.
- Each test type is categorized using the `TestType` enumeration.

```

**Inheritance:**
- None explicitly mentioned in the description, although we could consider Test as a base class for different types of tests (e.g., BloodTest, UltrasoundExam, etc.) if we wanted to add more specificity, but it is not necessary based on the provided requirements. 

This class diagram summarizes the core elements and relationships needed for the LabTracker software as described, capturing the crucial interactions between doctors, patients, requisitions, tests, appointments, and labs.
---------------------9/10---------3/5:
Base_AI_answer:Based on the provided description of the LabTracker software, here is the class diagram format with enumerations, classes, and relationships:

### Enumerations:
```plaintext
TestType(bloodTest, ultrasoundExam, xRay, urineSample, stoolSample)
RepetitionInterval(weekly, monthly, halfYear, yearly)
```

### Classes:
```plaintext
Doctor(practitionerNumber : int, fullName : String, address : String, phoneNumber : String, signature : Image, requisitionValidityDate : Date)
Patient(healthNumber : String, firstName : String, lastName : String, dateOfBirth : Date, address : String, phoneNumber : String)
Requisition(doctors : 1..*, doctor : Doctor, patients : 1..*, patient : Patient, tests : 0..*, testList : Test, repetitionCount : int, repetitionInterval : RepetitionInterval)
Test(testType : TestType, duration : int, results : String, report : String)
Lab(labName : String, registrationNumber : String, address : String, businessHours : String, fees : double)
Appointment(appointmentDate : Date, startTime : Date, endTime : Date, confirmationNumber : String, patient : Patient, lab : Lab)

1 Patient book 0..* Appointment
1 Requisition contain 0..* Test
1 Appointment associate 1 Lab
0..* Requisition contain 1..* Test
Doctor inherit Patient
```

### Additional Notes:
- The `Doctor` class has an inheritance relationship with `Patient`, as a doctor can also be a patient.
- The `Requisition` class aggregates/test list of `Test` objects since requisitions can contain multiple tests.
- `Test` has an association with `TestType` to define the type of test being conducted.
- Additional relationships like validity of a test or specific conditions (like not allowing doctors to prescribe tests on themselves) can be managed through business logic rather than class relationships due to their conditional nature.
---------------------9/10---------4/5:
Base_AI_answer:Here’s the class diagram represented in the specified format based on your description of the LabTracker software:

### Enumerations:
```
RepetitionInterval(weekly, monthly, halfYear, yearly)

1 Patient associate 0..* Requisition
1 Requisition contain 1..* Test
1 Requisition contain 0..1 Appointment
1 Test associate 0..* Result
1 Lab contain 0..* Appointment
```

### Inheritance:
```
Test inherit Requisition
```

### Composition:
```
1 Appointment contain 1 Lab
```

### Notes:
- The association between `Doctor` and `Requisition` indicates that one doctor can create multiple requisitions.
- The association between `Patient` and `Requisition` indicates that a patient can have multiple requisitions.
- Each `Requisition` can contain multiple `Test` instances, and it can optionally link to an `Appointment`.
- Each `Test` might have multiple `Result` instances indicating the outcomes of the tests.
- The `Lab` class contains multiple `Appointment` instances as labs can have multiple appointments booked.
- Tests aren’t directly related to a `Lab` in this specification but are associated through `Appointment` since appointments link patients, requisitions, and labs together.

### Notes on Relationships:
1. **Doctor to Requisition**: A doctor can create multiple requisitions but a requisition must be made by one doctor.
2. **Patient to Requisition**: A patient can have multiple requisitions and each requisition can only belong to one patient.
3. **Requisition to Test**: A requisition can contain multiple tests.
4. **Requisition to Appointment**: A requisition can optionally have an associated appointment.
5. **Appointment to Lab**: An appointment must be associated with one lab.
6. **Lab to Test**: A lab can offer multiple tests.

This structure captures the relationships, classes, and enumerations needed for the LabTracker system described.

Base_AI_answer:Based on the provided description, here is a class diagram representation including enumerations, classes, and relationships:

### Enumerations:
```plaintext
RepetitionInterval(weekly, monthly, half_year, yearly)
TestType(blood_test, ultrasound_examination, x_ray, urine_sample, stool_sample)
AppointmentStatus(confirmed, cancelled, pending)
```

### Classes:
```plaintext
Doctor(practitionerNumber : int, fullName : string, address : string, phoneNumber : string, digitalSignature : Image, validFrom : Date)
Patient(healthNumber : string, firstName : string, lastName : string, dateOfBirth : Date, address : string, phoneNumber : string)
Requisition(requisitionDate : Date, tests : List<Test>, patient : Patient, doctor : Doctor, repetitionCount : int, repetitionInterval : RepetitionInterval)
Test(duration : int, testType : TestType)
Appointment(confirmationNumber : string, appointmentDate : Date, startTime : Time, endTime : Time, status : AppointmentStatus, lab : Lab)
Lab(name : string, registrationNumber : string, address : string, businessHours : List<Time>, cancellationFee : double)
```

### Relationships:
```plaintext
1 Doctor associate 0..* Requisition
1 Requisition contain 1..* Test
1 Patient associate 0..* Requisition
0..* Test associate 1..* Appointment
1 Lab contain 0..* Appointment
0..* Appointment associate 1 Requisition
```

### Inheritance:
```plaintext
// Inheritance relationships are not specified in this description. 
// However, if we wanted to add more test types that share common attributes with the existing Test class, we could consider setting up an inheritance model for more specific test types.
```

### Composition:
```plaintext
1 Lab contain 0..* Test
```

### Explanation:
1. **Enumerations** define various fixed values that types like `RepetitionInterval` and `TestType` can take.
2. **Classes** represent the key entities in the system such as `Doctor`, `Patient`, `Requisition`, `Test`, `Appointment`, and `Lab`, each with their respective attributes.
3. **Relationships** illustrate how many instances of one class are associated with instances of another class, e.g., a `Doctor` can be associated with multiple `Requisition` instances.
4. **Composition** indicates that a `Lab` contains multiple `Test` instances, highlighting that tests belong to a lab.

This class diagram offers a structured overview of the LabTracker software's components and the relationships between those components.

``` 

### Explanation of Relationships:
- A `Doctor` can create multiple `Requisition` instances, but a `Requisition` is associated with exactly one `Doctor`.
- A `Patient` can have multiple `Requisition` instances, but a `Requisition` is associated with exactly one `Patient`.
- A `Requisition` can contain one or more `Test` instances.
- An `Appointment` can optionally be linked to a `Requisition`.
- A `Test` can be of multiple types but is referenced in a `Requisition`.
- An `Appointment` is associated with exactly one `Lab`.
- A `Lab` can have multiple `Appointment` instances associated with it.

This diagram provides a structured overview of the classes and their relationships within the LabTracker software system, encapsulating the core functionalities described.

Base_AI_answer:Sure, here is a class diagram representation based on your description, including enumerations, classes, and relationships:

### Enumerations:
```
RepetitionInterval(weekly, monthly, halfYear, yearly)
TestType(bloodTest, ultrasound, xray, urineTest, stoolTest)
```

### Classes:
```
Doctor(practitionerNumber : int, fullName : String, address : String, phoneNumber : String, signature : Image, validFromDate : Date)
Patient(healthNumber : String, firstName : String, lastName : String, dob : Date, address : String, phoneNumber : String)
Requisition(requisitionID : String, tests : List<Test>, patient : Patient, doctor : Doctor, repetitionPattern : RepetitionInterval, repetitionCount : int)
Test(testID : String, testType : TestType, duration : int, isAppointmentRequired : boolean)
Appointment(appointmentID : String, requisition : Requisition, lab : Lab, confirmationNumber : String, appointmentDate : Date, startTime : Time, endTime : Time)
Lab(labID : String, address : String, registrationNumber : String, businessHours : String, cancellationFee : double)
TestResult(test : Test, result : String, report : String)
```

### Relationships:
```
1 Doctor associate 0..* Requisition
1 Patient associate 0..* Requisition
1 Requisition contain 0..* Test
1 Requisition contain 0..1 Appointment
1 Appointment associate 1 Lab
0..* TestResult contain 1 Test
1 TestResult associate 1 Test
1 Doctor inherit Patient
```

### Explanation of Relationships:
- A doctor can create multiple requisitions (1 Doctor to 0..* Requisition).
- A patient can have multiple requisitions (1 Patient to 0..* Requisition).
- Each requisition can contain multiple tests (1 Requisition to 0..* Test).
- Each requisition can optionally have one appointment associated with it (1 Requisition to 0..1 Appointment).
- Each appointment is associated with exactly one lab (1 Appointment to 1 Lab).
- Each test can have multiple results associated with it (0..* TestResult to 1 Test).
- A test result corresponds to exactly one test (1 TestResult to 1 Test).
- The `Doctor` class can inherit from the `Patient` class if the software handles doctors as patients in some context (though the details imply it might not fit typical use cases directly).
 
This class diagram captures the core structure and relationships defined in the LabTracker software system for requisitioning tests and managing appointments.
